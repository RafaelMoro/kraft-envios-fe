## Overview

Kraft Envios uses a practical Flowbite React + Tailwind v4 interface: neutral dashboards, blue primary actions, rounded controls, and cookie-backed light/dark theme switching. Keep UI changes aligned with the existing utility-class style rather than introducing a parallel component or token system.

## Colors

The primary scale is Flowbite React's default `primary` blue scale. The project currently uses utilities such as `bg-primary-700`, `text-primary-700`, `focus:ring-primary-300`, and their dark variants.

- **Primary (#1A56DB):** main action color, normally used as `primary-700` in buttons.
- **Primary hover (#1E429F):** darker action state, normally `primary-800`.
- **Neutrals:** Tailwind/Flowbite gray scale for surfaces, borders, secondary text, dashboard backgrounds, and dark mode.
- **Danger (#C81E1E):** destructive or risk actions, mirroring the existing red button utility string.

Dark mode is driven by `<html data-theme="dark">` and Tailwind's custom `dark:` variant in `src/app/globals.css`; do not switch this to media or class mode unless the theme preference flow changes too.

### Accent

`accent` / `accent-muted` / `accent-subtle` / `accent-strong` / `accent-ink` are a decorative tan/gold ramp used only on the public landing (`src/features/Landing/`) — badges, chips, eyebrows, and gradients. They are **never** used for primary actions, links, focus states, or any interactive affordance; primary actions stay on `primary-*`.

Contrast, measured on the intended surfaces:

- `accent-strong` (`#8A6A30`) is the **only** accent token allowed as text on a light surface — ≈5.0:1 on white, passes AA.
- `accent` (`#C8A06A`) on white is 2.4:1 — fails AA for text. Use it only as a surface/border/gradient color, never as text.
- `accent-ink` (`#3D2F14`) on `accent-muted` (6.9:1) and on `accent-subtle` (9.6:1) are the approved tan-on-tan text pairings.

## Typography

The app loads Geist Sans and Geist Mono with `next/font/local` in `src/app/layout.tsx` from `src/app/fonts/GeistVF.woff` and `src/app/fonts/GeistMonoVF.woff`.

- Use **Geist Sans** for interface text, labels, dashboard content, and forms.
- Use **Geist Mono** only when the user explicitly asks for monospace or when a true code/diagnostic block requires fixed-width alignment; do not use it for guide numbers, IDs, prices, or metadata by default.
- Do not change font family unless explicitly requested; preserve the app-level Geist Sans typography.
- Existing Flowbite/Tailwind text utilities (`text-sm`, `text-base`, `font-medium`) are preferred over bespoke CSS.

## Layout

Tailwind v4 is configured in `src/app/globals.css` through `@import "tailwindcss"`, `@plugin 'flowbite-react/plugin/tailwindcss'`, and `.flowbite-react/class-list.json` as a source. There is no separate Tailwind config file.

Use Tailwind's default spacing scale. Existing dashboard-specific layout helpers are `.grid-dashboard` and `.grid-card-quote` in `src/app/globals.css`.

## Components

Buttons are currently represented by shared utility strings in `src/shared/constants/global.constants.ts`:

- `primaryButtonCSS`: filled primary button, `bg-primary-700`, white text, `hover:bg-primary-800`.
- `secondaryButtonCSS`: outlined primary button, primary text, primary hover fill.
- `darkRedButtonCSS`: outlined danger button with red hover fill.
- `greySecondaryCSS`: outlined gray secondary button.

Flowbite React remains part of the UI stack. Dashboard drawer header colors are customized locally in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` with `createTheme` and `ThemeProvider`.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do reuse Flowbite React components and existing shared button class strings before adding new component abstractions.
- Do keep primary actions on the Flowbite `primary-*` scale unless a real rebrand happens.
- Do run `pnpm design:lint` after editing this file.
- Don't generate Tailwind theme CSS from this file yet; it documents the current system for agents and humans.
- Don't add a second dark-mode mechanism; the app already uses `data-theme` with cookie persistence.

## Landing

The public landing at `/` (`src/features/Landing/`) is a deliberate set of exceptions to the rules above:

1. **Light-only by design.** Every landing section sets an explicit light surface color instead of inheriting the app body's `dark:bg-gray-950` — the landing must look correct even when `data-theme="dark"` is set on `<html>`.
2. **Hand-rolled FAQ accordion**, not Flowbite's `Accordion`. The landing renders outside the dashboard `ThemeProvider`, so Flowbite would apply untuned defaults, and the comp requires exactly-one-open-at-a-time with the first item open by default — worth a bespoke component rather than fighting the default.
3. **Sets its own Geist font-family class** (`font-[family-name:var(--font-geist-sans)]`) because `globals.css` still declares `body { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }`, which otherwise wins app-wide.
